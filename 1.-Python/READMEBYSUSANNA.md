I tried my best with these challenges. They are quite difficult compared to the basic lessons we got during the prework, but in some way, I could manage to find and learn more functions searching on the internet.
Anyway, the challenges have encouraged me to learn more Python, it turns out more and more addictive when you know how to solve things and when the outcome is right...wow!!
